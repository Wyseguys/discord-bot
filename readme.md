## You need to run python 3
 - Use Pip to install the following pages
 - `pip install python-dotenv`

 - `pip install discord`

## download these project files from git
In a command prompt, be IN the folder you want to keep your files. Run the following command to clone these to your local machine

`git clone https://github.com/Wyseguys/discord-bot.git . `


 ## Set up the environment
So you don't have to share secrets, copy the .env.example file in folder and rename the copy to .env.  Add your tokens to that file so the bot can read them.
